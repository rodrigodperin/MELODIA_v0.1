MELODIA: Multimodal Elerdly-Oriented Digital Intelligent Assistant (Preliminary Release)
Overview
Welcome to the preliminary release of MELODIA, an innovative AI-powered assistant designed to process and respond to your queries across multiple input modalities. MELODIA leverages an advanced AI model to understand your input and generate comprehensive audio responses along with corresponding text transcripts.

This executable version is a demonstration of MELODIA's core capabilities, offering a glimpse into its potential as a versatile tool for information retrieval and interaction.

Features
This preliminary version of MELODIA currently supports the following functionalities:

Multimodal Input:

Text Queries: Submit your questions directly as text. (Followed by the ENTER key or the 'Send' button)
E.g. Type in the command prompt: Are bats mammals?

Audio Queries: Speak your queries using live audio input, make sue you have a working microphone.
E.g. "Why is the sky blue?"

Camera Input (Visual Context): Provide real-time visual information via your camera to aid in query understanding.
E.g.: Try holding up two fingers and ask "How many fingers am I holding up?"

Screen Capture Input (Visual Context): Share your screen content to provide contextual information for your queries.
E.g.: Try asking "How many windows are open on my desktop now?"

File Upload: Load text files to submit queries about their content. Use the 'Add file' button.
A sample text is provided, try asking "What time should the patient take Metformin?" and hit the 'Query file' button.
For the moment the output from these queries is text only.

Audio Output with Transcripts: All responses from MELODIA are provided as synthesized audio, accompanied by a real-time text transcript for easy reference.

Current Limitations & Future Improvements
Please note that this is an early-stage release, and as such, it has certain limitations:

Limited Functionality: Not all intended features are fully implemented in this version.

User Interface (UI): The current user interface is preliminary. We are actively working on adapting and refining it to be more intuitive and clearly understandable for our target users.

Voice Communication: The voice interaction aspects are undergoing further development to enhance clarity and naturalness.

We are continuously working to improve MELODIA's capabilities, user experience, and overall performance.
